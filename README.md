# Serverless Microservice Patterns

This repository contains a collection of sample projects that demonstrate common serverless microservice architectural patterns using AWS Serverless services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, and more. Each pattern is implemented as a standalone project, providing practical examples and reference implementations for building scalable, event-driven microservices in the cloud.

## Patterns

The following patterns are currently included in this repository:

- [**Simple Web Service**](patterns/simple-web-service/README.md): A basic serverless web service pattern using API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB.

More patterns, such as Gatekeeper, Internal Web Service, Aggregator, and others, will be added over time.
