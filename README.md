# Serverless Microservice Patterns

This repository contains a collection of sample projects that demonstrate common serverless microservice architectural patterns using AWS Serverless services such as AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, and more. Each pattern is implemented as a standalone project, providing practical examples and reference implementations for building scalable, event-driven microservices in the cloud.

## Patterns

The following patterns are currently included in this repository:

- [**Simple Web Service**](patterns/simple-web-service/README.md): A basic serverless web service pattern using API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB.

More patterns, such as Gatekeeper, Internal Web Service, Aggregator, and others, will be added over time.

## Lambda Starter Project

The pattern projects in this repository provide a great reference for various serverless implementation techniques. However, they focus on the implementation of specific requirements in the code and do not illustrate all aspects of a complete software project. For example these pattern samples do not have examples of:

- CI/CD pipelines
- Full suite of documentation
- Pre-commit verifications
- AI coding assistant instructions

The [**Lambda Starter Project**](https://github.com/leanstacks/lambda-starter) provides an example of a complete serverless microservice project. Reference this project when starting your next serverless microservice application component.
